         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THis Religion (Mr. <hi>York-ſhire</hi>) is a very Seaſonable Garment; cool in Summer, hot in Winter, and Suits with Spring and Autumne both.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>York.</speaker>
               <p>Ay in troth, ſo 'tis; and I have a good mind to make me a Cloak on't; for that's the Wear I fancy moſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Why a Cloak, prethee?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Oh, Sir, Have you never experimented the Conveniency of that Garb? I'le tell you how it ſav'd me a Scouring once, when I met my Tutor full-but with my Neighbors Cock under my Cloak, who inquiring what I had got, was ſoon ſatisfied with this anſwer; <hi>'Twas a Riders Dictionary:</hi> God-a-mercy Cloak for that ſhift: I had as certainly gone to pot as the Cock did afterwards, had not my Cloak hid the Roguery.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Well, and ever ſince you love the wear.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, and ever ſhall do as long as I live for ſeveral ſubſtantial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; whereof I give this as one: That a man in a Religious Cloak may walk incognito, carry Vice on with Virtues Face, preſent his Friend a Dagger; when he expects but a How do you; and a ſhake by th'hand; appear upright, though ſtigmatiz'd and ill ſtampt by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>But what piece of Religion do you fancy moſt to make a Cloak on? There's the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-piece, the <hi>Présbyterian</hi> piece, the <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingers, Independents, Quakers,</hi> and the Lord knows what?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>I know that well enough, but the <hi>Roman</hi>-piece for me, that's the Original, and is moſt in Faſhion all o're the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Don't tell me of <hi>Rome, France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and them For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Places: I am for what is moſt worn in my own Country, and for that which my Father wore before me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Now you ſay ſomething; ha, ha, ha! Your Father wore before you, quoth the man; prethee how doeſt thou know what Cloaths thy Father wore?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Why I am ſure 'twas a Proteſtant Cloak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, but what was the Coat and Britches?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Faith I can't tell that, for the Cloak was always wrapt ſo cloſe about him, that the Devil himſelf could not ſee what Cut the Suit was of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Well with what Antiquary will you conſult for the Faſhion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Hold I-I-I have a pretty pattern of a Britches; but I—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Something like that on <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Half-Crown.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48956:2"/>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, ay, 'Twas the Half-Crown I had in my Head.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Pox o' that pattern, it coſt my Father a whole Crown, and I hate the Faſhion ever ſince, and dare not countenance it, leſt it ſhou'd coſt me one too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee, what doeſt talk of Faſhion? This is all the difference 'twixt ours and yours: We cut our Cloth according to Religion, you your Religion according to your Cloth; we make intereſt according to Religion, you Religion according to Intereſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Ay this Religion and Intereſt go glew'd together with you and us too; for which reaſon I'le make me ſuch a large <hi>Roman</hi> Cloak, that ſhall be ſubject enough for three Kingdoms to talk of.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I'le lay you a Crown; my Britches in <hi>Octavo,</hi> ſhall raiſe as much diſcourſe as your Cloak in <hi>Folio.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee don't think to bubble me out of my Crown ſo: I know not what correſpondence you have with the Rabble, I will not hazard any thing to their wavering Fancy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>That which you terme Correſpondence, perhaps may prove ſuch Influence, as ſhall be able to trounce you out of Fifteen Shillings; then how will you look when you've loſt Three Crowns, if you ſtick ſo much to hazard One.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Trounce me! what's trounce me? I am ſure you can't get it by Fair play, and therefore you muſt uſe ſome Cheat; and <hi>malè parta, malè dilabuntur,</hi> what's got over the Devils Back, is ſpent under his Belly. But God bleſs him that holds the ſtakes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amen,</hi> from you and all <hi>York-ſhire</hi> Blades.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Why from all <hi>York-ſhire</hi> Blades, do you think there's none ſound and honeſt of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I can't tell how ſound you are, but this I'me ſure, there has been a ſad Murrain among you: Neither know I your honeſty, but I believe there's not one of you wou'd ſtick to cut his Brothers Throat for intereſt, and that your red letter'd Calender ſignifies well enough.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee don't pretend to be ſo much of a Head-piece, as to make expoſitions on any thing: What's what is enough for you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Marry, but I know I may lawfully pretend to any Head-piece more than you, either to the Fore-piece, or Hind-piece, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the Crown-piece.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs you might have had better pretenſions than I far to't, had you not met with that unlucky Knock in your Cradle, which crack't your Crown.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>I vallue not that Knock, though it beat it flat; for I doubt not when the Colledge of Phyſitians ſhall ſet in <hi>commune bonum</hi> (for ev'ry ones diſeaſe) but they'le take me into cure too, and ſettle my Crown faſt enough I'le Warrant you, and I am reſolv'd to ſtand the Touch.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps your Body of phyſitians may work extraordinary things, and alter ev'n Natures courſe contrary to all right and reaſon; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you muſt Fee 'em high.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing ſhall be wanting toward ſo extraordinary a Cure, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diligence nor confidence; and then with what a Jeſuitical Face will you look?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Y.</speaker>
               <p>Troth I ſhall have reaſon enough to put on a ſowr countenance, but ſtay till it comes.</p>
